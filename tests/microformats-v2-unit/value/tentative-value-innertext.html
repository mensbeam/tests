<!--
    The Value Class Pattern parsing rules make mention of "inner-text", but
    this term is never defined. These tests assume that inner-text is the
    textContent property of elements, with no trimming applied.

    As neither u- nor e- property processing involves trimming and both p- and
    dt- property processing states to return the result of the VCP algorithm,
    trimming should never apply. This does not seem to be what many
    implementations do, however.
